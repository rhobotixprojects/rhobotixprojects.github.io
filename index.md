# Welcome to Rhobotix Projects

Thank you for visiting Rhobotix Projects! We are a small group of engineers dedicated to increasing our knowledgebase of embedded systems by undertaking various projects. This website will explain in detail the projects that we are currently working on.

All of the source code for our projects is available on our [github account](https://github.com/rhobotixprojects).

## LPC1114FN28/102 Flash Utility

In this project, we are creating software that will be used to flash the LPC1114FN28/102 microcontroller. This microcontroller contains an ARM Cortex-M0 processor. The software utility is developed in Python and can be used on a Linux OS.

## Security Systems Project

The goal of the project is to create a security system along with a phone app, the security system will alert the user via the phone app if the security system is activated.
To start the project we can use the Rasberry Pi, a camera (we can start with a camera that is connected via a USB cable, then move to a wireless camera. Also we need a sensor like the ping))) to detect movement. 

If the ping))) detects movement it will send a specific signal to the Rasberry Pi, which will send a command to the camera to take a picture and/or start streaming video. 

The Rasberry Pi will also send a notification to the user, via email first, then maybe via app to start viewing the live camera feed to see what is going on. 

This will help us get familiar with the rasberry pi, and write programs to work with the GPIO pins, and go thru a series of commands if certain conditions are met. 

Once we create the app, this will also get our familiar with what it takes to create a phone app.
